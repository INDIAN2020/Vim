# This is my favorite vim set, to use it ,just copy
	vim73/gvimfullscreen.dll (for fullscreen on windows)
	vim73/vimtweak.dll(for background transparent) to your vim73 directory.
then copy the vimfiles directory and the _vimrc file to your vim location, I used [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen.git) to manage my plugins
