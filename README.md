# This is my favorite vim set, to use it ,just copy below files and folders to your gVim location
	*vim73/gvimfullscreen.dll (for fullscreen on windows)
	*vim73/vimtweak.dll(for background transparent) to your vim73 directory.
	*_vimrc file
I used [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen.git) to manage my plugins
